                <div class="content-body">
                     <p>Hello everyone! Let me introduce myself — my name is Nur Aeni, and some of my friends like to call me Ayy. I was born in the warm and humble city of Cirebon on July 6, 2004.</p>
                     <p>I'm a girl who enjoys learning new things, exploring creativity, and finding inspiration from simple moments. Music has always been my companion — one of my favorite songs is Teenage Blue by Dreamgirl. It has a calm, emotional vibe that speaks to me in ways words can't always express.</p>
                     <p>Books are another world I love to escape to. I'm especially fond of the Harry Potter series — the magic, the friendships, and the adventures have left a deep impression on me.</p>
                     <p>If I had to sum up my life outlook, it would be this: "If you never bleed, you are never gonna grow." I believe that challenges shape us and pain teaches us how strong we truly are.</p>
                     <p>Nice to meet you, and thanks for stopping by. I hope we can get to know each other better!</p>
