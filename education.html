                    <p>I began my educational journey at SDN Silih Asuh 3 Kota Cirebon, where I studied from 2010 to 2016. The school was not far from home, making it easy to enjoy my daily routines. During these years, I actively participated in extracurricular activities, especially traditional dance. Performing in front of audiences at school events helped me gain early confidence and a love for cultural arts.</p>
                    <p>After graduating from elementary school, I continued to SMPN 13 Kota Cirebon from 2017 to 2019. Junior high was an exciting phase where I made many new friends and joined both the Red Cross Youth (PMR) and traditional dance activities. These experiences taught me teamwork, empathy, and self-expression. One of the most memorable moments was during our farewell ceremony, where my class performed a dance together — it was fun and unforgettable.</p>
                    <p>Next, I attended SMKS Wahidin Kota Cirebon from 2020 to 2022. Since the school was farther from home, I was often dropped off by my parents. In high school, I joined the English Club, which improved my speaking skills and helped me feel more confident using English in everyday situations. It was a space where I could share ideas, learn new expressions, and make friends with similar interests.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I’m continuing my education at STMIK IKMI Kota Cirebon, majoring in Information Systems. I’m excited about this chapter of my life, where I get to explore the world of technology and grow academically and personally.</p>
